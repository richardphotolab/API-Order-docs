## Overview

The Shipped API is a private REST interface for approved Richard partners to query for pending newly shipped orders.

### Support

For API support, please email api.support@richardphotolab.com

## Method: `GET`

This method returns all orders currently marked as shipped _and_ not marked as received by you.
> :warning: Keep in mind that every shipping notification must be acknowledged as received before it will be removed from the pending list. Therefore, if your pending and acknowledge processes are running out of sync, be sure to accommodate for possible duplicates in the pending list.

### Response

> :warning: This information is specific to this endpoint. You must *_also_* understand the [basic RESPONSE documentation](../REQUEST.md).
